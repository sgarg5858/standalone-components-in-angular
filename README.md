1-app-using-scam-pattern

In this branch we have initial setup of the application which lazy loads Modules with and without router! We have used SCAM(Single Component Angular Module) Pattern to setup this basic project => Standalone Components behind the scenes used SCAM Pattern, every declarable have their own module.

We will migrate this project to use Standalone Components!
